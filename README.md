# DayZ Cleanup Script

This script is used to delete log files, RPT files, and mdmp files from the DayZ folder. This can help free up disk space.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- DayZ installed on the computer
- Administrator privileges
- A text editor such as Notepad

## Installation

- [Download](https://github.com/Jubaroo/Start_Dayz/releases/tag/1.0) the .bat file from releases.

## Usage

1. Right-click on the `dayz_cleanup.bat` file and select "Edit" to open it in a text editor.
2. Review the script to make sure it meets your needs. If you want to modify the list of file extensions to delete, you can edit the `for` loop in the script.
3. Save the `dayz_cleanup.bat` file and close the text editor.
4. Right-click on the `dayz_cleanup.bat` file and select "Run as administrator".
5. Wait for the script to finish deleting the files. If any files are deleted, the total size of deleted files will be displayed.
6. After the cleanup is complete, DayZ will automatically launch in 5 seconds.

## Troubleshooting

- If the script encounters an error, it will display an error message and pause. Check the error message and try to resolve the issue before running the script again.
- If DayZ does not launch after the cleanup is complete, try launching it manually from the Steam client.
